# BankLoan-Analytics

In this project, I work with data from the Excel file 'bank_loan.csv', containing 38,000 records of bank loan data that was approved in 2021. I use SQL to identify key performance indicators (KPI's) that helps banks and financial companies make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform their lending strategies.
All SQL queries are included in the document titled 'Bank Loan Query Doc'. 

Next, I created a PowerBI dashboard, Summarizing KPI's and displaying trends using graphs and charts, such as the total loan applications per state, Ratio of Good Loans to bad loans and many others, included in the Bank_Loan.pbix file and displayed below.
