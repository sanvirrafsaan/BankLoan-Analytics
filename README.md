# BankLoan-Analytics

In this project, I work with data from the Excel file 'bank_loan.csv', containing 38,000 records of bank loan data that was approved in 2021. I use SQL to identify key performance indicators (KPI's) that helps banks and financial companies make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform their lending strategies.

All SQL queries are included in the document titled 'Bank Loan Query Doc'.
